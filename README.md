MoneyHoney - front-end capstone Single Page web application built with React JS. Enables customers and Financial advisors to connect and interact intuitively to document and navigate through the complexities of insurance and investment.
Customers can keep their information up-to-date and follow policy and investment documentation. 
Financial Advisors can not only view their clientsâ€™ policies & investments, but can also view & add new product offerings. Both roles have access to live stock market integration on investment products. The application utilizes heavy API usage and is data-dense.

Technologies Used: React, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Cloudinary, CanvasJS, JSON Server.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In the mh_api directory, you'll need to run:
### `json-server -p 8088 database.json -w`

The live stockmarket feature will not dynamically update as I did need to pay for a subsription for the API to do as many API fetch calls as I was for the feature and I am no longer paying for that subscription at this time.
